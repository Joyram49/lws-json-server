      "description": "As we already know, the web is made up of two main parts. The frontend and the backend. The frontend is concerned with presentation and is fairly easy to understand since it is what we interact with daily on the web. The backend, on the other hand, is all of the parts of the web that users do not directly interact with. In this video we are going to discuss the basics of how the backend of a website works by tracing all of the steps that the backend must go through from the moment it receives a request to the point it sends a response back to the client.",
